# mdblog

A simple markdown blogging engine written in clojure.

This just generates a basic site and maintains the metadata. You have all the flexibility in the world to change the site as you see fit. Just edit public/js/site.js to change functionality.

## Installation

I'm the only one using this, so it's gonna be git.

Or if you want to use it, you can uberjar it.

## Usage

Usage: ```java -jar mdblog.jar [command] [args]```

Or put the jar in a runnable shell script. I do not remember how to do this, but it's easily searchable.

See project.clj aliases for the list of commands.
